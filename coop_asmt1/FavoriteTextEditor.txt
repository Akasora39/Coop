My favorite text editor is Notepad++ because of its ability to work with various programming languages simply by saving a file as a specific extension.
This is very convenient as most coding for large projects would typically be done on an IDE which only works with a specific set of PLs but Notepad++ is
convenient for small scale testing especially considering that it does not take a long time to load as other IDEs normally would take. Overall, the efficiency
that Notepad++ offers for such instances of coding is one of the reasons why Notepad++ is appealing. Because of its small file size, it is possible to even 
store Notepad++ on a USB drive or any other portable storage device to run on which adds to its convenience.
Another reason is the user interface that Notepad++ offers. While it may not seem as up to date as other programs, the presence of a UI is helpful because 
it will most likely seem familiar to people that use various programs that feature a similar UI based on its simplicity. Aside from that, it is even possible
for the user to customize the UI making personalization an option which may help users adjust the design to something that resembles another program's UI that
they like. Overall, the personalization that Notepad++ offers sets it apart from other text editors and shows that one of the main pros it has to offer is 
being convenient on the user.
