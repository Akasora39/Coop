Repo for Coop Assignment 1

1. Text editor description is found in the file FavoriteTextEditor.txt
   Formatting may be off so viewing the file raw will be more convenient.
2. Shell script named Q2.sh and Shell Scripting.png are the script and screenshot respectively.
   Written on vim through Linux virtual machine with VirtualBox. 
   All test files that were used on the script have been attached minus the empty files which were deleted in the process.
3. Added files for part 2 of assignment to this repo. 
   local_test_branch was made for demonstrating branching and merging but merge changes were not recorded so test2 branch was made to do this.
   All actions were done through the terminal aside from deleting a duplicate Q2.sh file
